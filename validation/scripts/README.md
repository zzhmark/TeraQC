# About TeraQC Python Pipeline
This is the Python implementation of the TeraQC algorithms meant for checking its validity before development, which can
be used if you don't intend to install the plugin version.

They are in the form of Jupyter notebooks. You can run them one by one with your own data, or turn them into a complete 
pipeline, which can be easily done as the functions are well-defined.

## Usage
These scripts are arranged in the following steps:
1. Sinusoidal stripes removal
2. PCA registration
3. Band removal
4. ROI extraction
5. Call image quality analysis
